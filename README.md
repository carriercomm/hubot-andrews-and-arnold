# Hubot Andrews and Arnold

We use Andrews & Arnold as our ISP. I thought it'd be handy to check the quota available from without hubot

## Configuration

You need to set the following:

 - `HUBOT_AA_NET_API_USER` needs to be set to the AA.net API Username (your clueless username)
 - `HUBOT_AA_NET_API_PASS` needs to be set to the AA.net API Password (your clueless password)

## Commands

`hubot: isp quota` - Show how much of the quota has been used.
